Unit tests
----------

Writing unit tests for registered features and commands are easy and you don't
have to mock the whole language server. If you skipped advanced usage page,
take a look at :ref:`passing language server instance <passing-instance>`
section for more details.

Json Extension example's `unit tests`_ might be helpful.
